## JurrasicFractal
Experimenting with Dynamic Programming by programming some Fractals (Harterâ€“Heighway dragon) in C++. 

## Dependencies
I'm using a drawing library for C++. You can find the library (library.h) here (http://rabbit.eng.miami.edu/class/library/index.html), you need the header and the object file.
